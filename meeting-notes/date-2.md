## Meeting notes

### **I. Meeting overview and recap of Advisory Committee purpose**

Draft charter for the OSAC is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwKLo_9YXwOKRKyaOxN1Wxc6i8cirTH24qIVpYsVW2E/edit?usp=sharing).

### **II. Key Issue: Collaborating with external partners**

#### **Project case study: Affordable Housing Inventory**

Project overview

* City currently has an affordable housing inventory in open data that is not real time or user friendly.
* 3 main sources of data: NHCD, Housing Authority properties \(state entity\), and market rate affordable housing.
* Current project aims to merge the 3 sources of housing data to provide a real-time view into affordable housing options and availability.
* Received $25k seed money in FY18 budget to get this started.
* Collaboration with external partners has been beneficial in the access to expertise.

Discussion

* Challenge of integrating data. Austin does not have a singular registry for affordable housing like San Francisco.
* Currently focused on making data more available and accessible so that a 3rd party might be able to develop an interface/application. NHCD lacks funding for development of an interface/application right now.
* Planning for a RFP for application development. NHCD has engaged external partners in advisory roles for that RFP.
* Issue of 3rd party assistance in the development of a competitive procurement. Potential for an advisor to an RFP to conflict themselves out of bidding on the RFP.
* Another option = open challenge/competition centered on how we might get real time data to users that need to know where to go to find housing. Similar model to ReVerse Pitch competition hosted by ARR and Economic Development.

#### **Project case study: Smart Second Street**

Project overview:

* Challenge of a lack of information on smart city activities on Second Street. Economic Development Department managed the development of Second Street. Governance of the project is not clear.
* Ownership and management of data from sensors and other data collection on Second Street are not clear.
* Desire for more communication to the Second Street retailers regarding data collection on the street.

Discussion:

* Interest in looking into case studies in smart city governance from other cities: Kansas City, Chicago.
* Collaborations with external partners are critical. Opportunity to pilot and prototype solutions outside of government, with more flexible procurement and technology processes.
* The redesigned IT governance process can help with questions of data and information management and security.
* Austin Transportation Department’s process for [pilot/partnership requests](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/COA_P3_Intake) offers some lessons for piloting with business partners.

#### **Project case study: Smart kiosks**

Project overview:

* Many different vendors active in kiosk market.
* The precise goals of kiosk projects are not clear. Using kiosks to provide public services \(ex: city service information, public service announcements, bus times\) is a different business model from promoting local business \(ex: live music, restaurants, events around town\). These have implications for funding models \(ex: advertising vs. city contract\) and how we evaluate success.

Discussion:

* Funding models: Industry assumes they will fund kiosks through advertising -- that a city won’t pay for it outright. But if the kiosk helps with outcomes \(ex: digital inclusion, health\), then kiosks can serve a municipal purpose.
* Need for prototyping and testing of kiosks to determine if they are successful at a small scale first.
* Sign ordinance affects kiosk plans. Questions remain on how the sign ordinance applies to splash pages you receive on your phone for public wifi in parks.

### **III. Lightning updates from Working Groups**

#### **Governance working group \(Elaine Nicholson\)**

Group has met twice to identify challenges related to legal and policy guidance. Working with Austin Transportation Department’s intake process to produce similar checklists and contractual language.

#### **Emerging tech working group \(Kerry O’Connor\)**

City was awarded $100K grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies for exploration of blockchain for identity management. Aim to share the process and learnings from this project.

#### **Projects working group \(Stephen Elkins\)**

Group has met to flesh out the scope and deliverables of the working group and how it relates to the other working groups. Interest in how we might prioritize smart city projects.

#### **Equitable outcomes working group \(John Speirs\)**

Currently in a process of discovery -- how might we produce equitable outcomes from smart city projects. Focusing on demographic data collection and the need to have disaggregated data to determine outcomes for different communities.

### **IV. Closing**

#### Close loop on updated Advisory Committee charter

Approval of charter deferred to future meeting.

#### **Recap of action items and future agenda items**

* Interest in Austin Transportation Department’s intake process.
* Interest in clearer guidance on how departments can and should partner with external organizations.
