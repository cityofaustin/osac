## Meeting notes

### I. Welcome and meeting overview

* Last meeting: September 2018, discussed smart city infrastructure and connectivity issues. 
* This meeting: Revisit how we collaborate with vendors and tech industry, and align these collaborations with Strategic Direction 2023.

#### Introduction to new US Ignite technical lead for Austin 

* Seth Collins gave a brief overview of his background and US Ignite's Smart Gigabit Communities program. Ignite's plans for 2019 were bookmarked for a future meeting discussion topic. 

### II. Key issue: Vendor and industry collaborations to achieve outcomes in 2019

#### A. Affordable housing inventory next steps

Speakers: Josh Rudow \(NHCD\), Rohan Mathur \(Code for America Fellow\)

Materials: [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1imwrij97y6dgMFALihQB9S2bCN0N0FA8OGFBXNMEeX8/edit?usp=sharing)

Discussion:

* How it will be updated: Working on an MOU with Housing Authority of City of Austin and Travis County to keep data up to date. Continuing to explore data contributions from landlords and engagement with Tenants Council. 
* Looking at ways for users to maintain profiles with preferences and attributes -- customized for the individual user.
* Project would benefit from a written agreement to formalize the working relationships of all partners. 
* Concept was championed early with Austin CityUP's housing committee. Project was allocated $25k in Council's FY2018 budget. 
* Current challenges regarding the business model for funding the product. Private sector partners have expressed interest in monetizing the tool, but have yet to find a viable model for a tool focused on access to affordable housing. 
* Project was championed in the [Impact Hub affordability accelerator](https://impacthubaustin.com/aha/2018-cohort/). Uncertainty around how the project would invest additional funding if received. 

#### B. 2019 plans for outcome summits and industry engagement

Speakers: Daniel Honker \(Innovation\), Marni Wilhite \(CTM\), Ben Guhin \(CTM\)

Materials: [Background memo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x2yiha3IxwIu0yph_G-BSk4fihXE4msI), [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1994koxOBC5p1POd9BoNmDnidqBepko6W5HpkFL4XSgs/edit?usp=sharing)

Discussion:

* Interest in how to incentivize vendors to engage in this process and through this intake form. A big part of the success of this effort will be to what extent vendors see value and results from participating and would go to this "front door" instead of other departments. 
* CTM is piloting the intake form and outcome summits. If successful, we will require resourcing to staff these processes in an ongoing way. 
* Outcome summits will aim to be as inclusive as possible, including a broad definition of community, including vendors, associations, residents, service providers.
* Desired results of the outcome summits for vendors: They have a clear way to engage with the City through the purchasing/contracting process. Pathways might include procurement, zero-dollar contracts \(pilots, etc.\), data sharing agreements. 
* Zero-dollar contracts: The City anticipates the budget to be flat in coming years. This will make zero-dollar contracts/pilots more attractive -- and these contracts have had risks regarding data ownership, security, law, and decision making authority in the past. City leadership will need to clarify guidance.
* Value in a process that would evaluate proposals early and give departments a pre-vetting "shelf" of options. 
* The vetting process would need to determine how proposals fit within a portfolio aimed at achieving outcomes, and within an architecture of technology. The process should also account for services and solutions already existing or planned. 
* Next step: briefing City Manager's Office February 6, 2019. 

#### C. Cities Coalition for Digital Rights opportunity 

Speaker: Charles Purma \(CTM\)

Materials: [Cities Coalition for Digital Rights website](https://citiesfordigitalrights.org/)

Discussion:

* Open call for cities become a member of this coalition. For City of Austin, this is an opportunity to take stock of how prepared we are in policy and process to engage in a more digital world. 
* Opportunity to learn from case studies of "smart city" problems in other cities that involved data ownership, privacy, transparency, and governance. 
* These principles align with efforts and standards being pursued by Information Management Governing Board, Information Security, Law, Equity Office, and Digital Inclusion. 
* CTM is posting a position for a lead on privacy policy that would be a thought leader on issues like this.
* Interest in taking this list of principles and building out a more exhaustive list of principles for Austin that would guide our own roadmap. 
* Next step: CTM to continue vetting, will host information gathering call with Cities Coalition.   

### III. Announcements and updates

#### Updates from working groups 

* Equitable outcomes: Continuing to explore demographic data standards and collection practices, in service of being able to measure impacts of services on different communities.  
* Governance: Involved in the CTM intake process. Drafting templates and standard contract language for collaboration with outside entities. 
* Emerging tech: Will focus on building this working group in 2019. Innovation Office is continuing to explore models for use of blockchain for identity management for people experiencing homelessness. 
* Projects: 

#### Announcements and requests

* Coordinating and operating aerial drones across departments. 
  * Use cases in incident response, emergency management, public safety
  * Challenges in operating and de-conflicting drones among multiple operators has implications for policy, protocol, training, and technology configuration. 
  * Interest in collaborating across departments on drones. Example: One department able to send out a drone on behalf of another department. 
  * Austin Energy has convened nine departments currently using drones and is exploring issues of governance and coordination. Need to invite more departments. 
* Interest in discussing CTM enterprise architecture, privacy, and CTO position. 

### IV. Closing

#### Recap of action items and future agenda items 

Future agenda items:

* Coordinating and operating aerial drones across departments.
