### I. Welcome and meeting overview

* Last meeting: [April 12, 2019](april-12-2019.md). Discussed future technology scenarios and their risks, including what roles the City might take to safeguard privacy and promote equity.
* This meeting continues a focus on the City's readiness for the changing technology landscape. 

### II. Results and lessons from CTM smart city pilot intake process

Recap and lessons learned from an initial intake of a proposal for interactive kiosks. Speaker: Daniel Honker

Presentation \([link to slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k7DtNw5f3fVcy9ZSOLMuV46hxF25o1GidfGtes52KMc/edit#slide=id.g412e1f5569_6_113)\):

* CTM undertook a pilot intake process to evaluate a vendor proposal for smart city pilot projects. The process considered one industry submission, for a pilot of interactive kiosks. 
* Through this process, CTM sought to flesh out a model the City might use for vetting and prioritizing technology proposals, focused on resident impacts, benefits to the City government, and feasibility considerations \(risk, security, cost, etc.\). 
* Multiple departments vetted the kiosk proposal, which did not receive enough departmental interest to move forward. 
* CTM presented lessons learned in using the intake process, which the department is integrating into its organizational transformation. 
* CTM is also continuing to flesh out the prioritization model through the [Service Access project](https://bit.ly/service-access), which aims to inventory paper-based City services to redesign or digitize. 

### III. Overview of [Civic Futures Summit](https://civicfutures.io/)

Presentation on this City of Austin-hosted conference October 1-2, including speakers and skills workshops for City staff. Speaker: Ben Guhin

Presentation:

* The City of Austin will host the Civic Futures Summit \([civicfutures.io](https://civicfutures.io/)\) October 1-2. 
* Agenda includes workshops, mainstage speakers, and awards
* Participants can [nominate colleagues](https://civicfutures.io/#awards) for Civic Futures Awards which recognize those who are shaping the future across state and local government in Central Texas. 
* City employees can register through TRAIN.

### IV. Smart Mobility update 

Mobility data specification and Ford One City Challenge. Speaker: Jason JonMichael

Presentation on the Mobility Data Specification and open source mobility data:

* The [Mobility Data Specification](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification#mobility-data-specification) \(MDS\) is a data standard used across many cities for mobility services \(e.g., scooters, ride hailing services\). 
* Austin supports MDS and has implemented some but not all of its provisions. Some MDS provisions may be prohibited under state law. 
* Related to MDS, the City of Austin is a member of the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/), a foundation that creates a governance structure around open-source mobility tools. 

Presentation on the Ford City:One Challenge

* The City of Austin has partnered with Ford on the [City:One Challenge,](https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/austin) a reverse-pitch process in which communities identify challenges and suggest solutions for issues at the intersection of mobility and healthy living.
* Ideas will be evaluated through several rounds, arriving at a finalist round of 12 ideas who receive resources to develop a full pilot proposal. The top application\(s\) will receive up to $100K for piloting.

### V. Announcements and updates \(20 min\)

#### **A. Drones advisory group update \(Rey Arellano\)**

* Group is working with the Law Department to formalize its structure, which may follow a similar charter to the Open and Smart Advisory Committee. 
* One issue the group will explore: How to de-conflict among drones operated by different departments during incident response. 

#### **B. Anchor institution umbrella agreement \(Ted Lehr\)**

* CTM is working with the University of Texas and Huston-Tillotson University on an umbrella research agreement to streamline collaboration toward civic goals. 
* CTM will convene a research group in August to explore research around drones. UT will manage the research, and City of Austin will manage the right-of-way. 
* CTM is preparing to brief the City Manager's Office on the proposed agreement, after which will convene a City staff team focused on research use cases. Agreement will likely take the form of an interlocal agreement between City of Austin and the universities. 

#### **C. Digital Inclusion Week announcement \(John Speirs\)**

* Digital Inclusion Week is October 7-11, 2019.
* Programming will include collaborations with Austin Public Library, Goodwill, Public Access, American Youth Works, and other partners convened through the [Digital Empowerment Community of Austin](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/digital-empowerment-community-austin).
* Additional ideas for programming should be directed to Jesse Rodriguez.

**D. Updates from working groups**

* **Governance** \(Elaine Nicholson\): Assisting in standing up an advisory group for drones. Lead for drones group is Victor Carr. Ford One:City Challenge is set for the August 8 Council agenda. Interest in several areas: 1\) standardizing templates for Council postings on technology procurement and security; 2\) encouraging pilots to be a short of duration as possible.  
* **Emerging tech** \(Kerry O'Connor\): Received Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to prototype a digital identity solution for people experiencing homelessness. Currently recruiting a four-person team that can design and develop with blockchain. Goal is to understand the integration points with local service providers \(including City programs such as Public Health and Austin Energy\). 
* **Projects** \(Stephen Elkins\): Currently focused on [service access project](https://bit.ly/service-access) to inventory City services that we could digitize and redesign. That inventory will provide some priority areas for new projects. 
* **Equitable outcomes** \(John Speirs\): Austin Public Health has created guidance on how to collect demographic data based on age/race/ethnicity. Will share with the OSAC network.
