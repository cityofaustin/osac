### **I. Welcome and meeting overview**

* This meeting comes after SXSW and will explore future scenarios of emerging technology and what we as a City need to be thoughtful of right now.

### **II. Key issue: SXSW debrief and future emerging technology scenarios**

Attendees discussed emerging technologies and risks and the role of the City using the [Institute for the Future’s ethicalOS](https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ethical-OS-Toolkit-2.pdf) toolkit. Discussion centered on [three possible future scenarios](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fMeC9hbdCvNgrMzPmOhF1cTZeZGWD8rtuxZROOCeJM8/edit#slide=id.g5f87006509c16c33_45). 

Below are sticky note responses to a set of debrief questions that prompted discussion on how the City of Austin might prepare for these scenarios. The debrief questions included:

1. What are the **common risks** we’ve seen across these scenarios?
2. What **current efforts** might help us address some of these risks?
3. What **new efforts** might we need? What issues are we not addressing right now? 

![Common risks seen across the scenarios. Summary of risks identified: predatory business models, obscurity of data collection and usage, exploitation of privacy and personally identifiable information, disparate impacts for historically marginalized groups, lack of government readiness and skill in this area.](../.gitbook/assets/common-risks.jpg)

![Current and planned City efforts that might help us prepare for these scenarios. Summary of current efforts: regulatory and data protection actions, security awareness, pilot process to assess risk, partnerships with other organizations. ](../.gitbook/assets/current-efforts.jpg)

![New efforts the City might night to explore to address issues we are we not yet addressing. Summary of new efforts needed: Determine the role of government, develop City policy, build the City&apos;s data science capability, educate city leaders and residents, partner with more organizations and cities globally](../.gitbook/assets/new-efforts.jpg)

### **III. Announcements and updates**

Update on plans for industry engagement and pilot intake \(from [January 2019 meeting](january-25-2019.md#b-2019-plans-for-outcome-summits-and-industry-engagement)\):

* CTM is planning a public event focused on design and technology for around September 2019. 
* CTM is also piloting an intake process for pilots, demos, and project requests, modeled after [Austin Transportation Department's expression of interest process](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbR48BiW-y7g7nX9amCdHEk6L2vqjnhD2lUqNleQ_TKV49oQ/viewform). The process aims to create consistent criteria for vetting and accepting pilots, demos, and projects across CTM. 

Updates from [working groups](../working-groups.md):

* **Governance** \(Elaine Nicholson\): Convening a drone advisory group to develop more formal governance and coordination around aerial drone usage. 
* **Emerging Tech** \(David Rauch\): The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation named MyPass \(blockchain for identity access for people experiencing homelessness\) as a finalist for a $400k grant
* **Projects** \(Stephen Elkins\): Looking into how the City might centralize and share information on emerging technology projects.  
* **Equity** \(John Speirs\): Moving forward with pilot to distribute refreshed city computers to community nonprofits. Pilot will include collection of disaggregated data to measure impacts on different communities.

Announcements and requests:
