# Projects

As part of our smart city initiative, we are compiling a list of local projects that align with our [definition of “smart city”](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/smart-city/about/definition/) for Austin. In sharing and updating this list, we hope to:

* Bring more awareness to the kinds of technology projects Austin is investing in
* Make these projects more transparent and accessible
* Spark more engagement and collaboration on these efforts with the Austin community

### Update in progress

We are collecting updates to this list, based on an [original list](https://airtable.com/embed/shrw1eaApYvCI2fbE/tbluO6vp5XB2GwYk4/viwPqpeM7kQ69dSC5) put together in 2017. [Click here to open a larger view](https://airtable.com/shr6ZZT3ngiWpKKvj/tblQXFH8dwIBq5LWj).
