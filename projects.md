We are updating the project inventory in 2018. [Click here to view the work-in-progress updated list](https://airtable.com/shr6ZZT3ngiWpKKvj/tblQXFH8dwIBq5LWj).

### About the inventory

As part of our smart city initiative, we are compiling a list of local projects that align with our [definition of “smart city”](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/smart-city/about/definition/) for Austin. In sharing and updating this list, we hope to:

* Bring more awareness to the kinds of technology projects Austin is investing in
* Make these projects more transparent and accessible
* Spark more engagement and collaboration on these efforts with the Austin community
